/* Take-Home Assignment 3

   1. Working with other people in the class (shared folder, email, text,
      telephone, telepathy, IP over Avian Carriers, or whatever method of
      communication) decide on an object that has not yet been implemented
      ( or needs to be largely fixed or altered) (perhaps a Java class
      representing a car, house, computer, being, container structure)
   2. decompose the object into a number of components
   3. split the components up among the group, but try to be sure that each
      of ou has at least one component that is likely to communicate somehow
      with another component (may not work for everyone's projects, so let me
      know if you this this will be difficult for your project)
   4. as a team, design some tests for each of the components
   5. implement your assigned component(s), but do not worry too much if it does
      not end up properly communicating with your team's objects as we will expand
      on this area in the next project
   6. create a basic GUI showing what inputs and outputs your component could use
      on its own (it does not need to be an interactive GUI yet, just get or set
      some text or other object state as the program starts up; even better, you
      could get the values from a file!)

   	  Note: remember to add the components to the panel and the panel to the frame!
   7. test your implementation with the tests that your team came up with (and more
      as you think of them)
   8. be ready to discuss how things go with your team when new next meet
