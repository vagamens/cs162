/* Take-Home Assignment 5

   1. each member individually implements a prototype of the design that
      the team worked on in class (input buttons and such do not have to
      do anything when clicked yet)
   2. find a recursively defined structure or system (not including the
      one we talked about in class) and create some program that
      demonstrates it using recursive method(s) (this does not have to be
      in a GUI, but it could be if you wanted to).
