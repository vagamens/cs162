## 8.12

What would happen if, in the `Dots` program, we did not provide empty definitions for one or more of the unused mouse events?

## 8.13

The `Dots` program listens for a mouse press event to draw a dot. How would the program behave differently if it listened for a mouse released event instead? A mouse clicked event?

## 8.14

What would happen if the call to `super.painComponent` were removed from the `paintComponent` method of the `DotsPanel` class? Remove it and run the program to test your answer.

## 8.15

What would happen if the call to `super.paintComponent` were removed from the `painComponent` method of the `RubberLinesPanel` class? Remove it and run the program to test your answer. In what ways is the answer different from the answer to 8.13?
