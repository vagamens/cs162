# Exercise 4

pg 373: 7.1, 7.2, 7.4, 7.6, 7.7

## 7.1

Write a method called `average` that accepts two integer parameters and returns their average as a floating point value.

## 7.2

Overload the `average` method of 7.1 to accepts four integer parameters and return their average.

## 7.4

Write a method called `multiConcat` that takes a `String` and an integer as parameters. Return a `String` that consists of the string parameter concatenated with itself `count` times, where `count` is the integer parameter. For example, if the parameter values are `"hi"` and `4`, the return value is `"hihihihi"`. Return the original string if the integer is less than 2.

## 7.6

Write a method called `drawCircle` that draws a circle based on the method's parameters: a `Graphics` object through which to draw the circle, two integer values representing the (x, y) coordinates of the center of the circle, another integer that represents the circle's radius, and a `Color` object that defines the circle's color. The method does not return anything.

## 7.7

Overload the `drawCircle` method of 7.6 such that if the `Color` parameter is not provided, the circle's color will default to black.
