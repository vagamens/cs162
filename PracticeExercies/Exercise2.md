# Exercise 2

pg 434: 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9, 8.10

## 8.6

write code that sets each element of an array called `nums` to the value of the constant `INITIAL`.

	int[] array;
	int INITIAL = 10;

	for(int i=0;i<array.length;i++) {
		array[i] = INITIAL;
	}

## 8.7

write code that prints the values stored in an array called `names` backwards.

## 8.8

write code that sets each element of a `boolean` array called `flags` to alternating values(`true` at index 0, `false` at index 1, etc.).

## 8.9

write a method called `sumArray` that accepts an array of floating point values and returns the sum of the values stored in the array.

## 8.10

write a method called `switchThem` that accepts two integer arrays as parameters and switched the contents of the arrays. take into account that the arrays may be of different sizes.
