# Exercise 9

pg 612: 12.2, 12.4, 12.6, 12.7, 12.10

## 12.2

Write a recursive definition of `xy` (`x` raised to the power `y`), where `x` and `y` are integers and `y` > 0.

## 12.4

Write a recursive definition of the Fibonacci numbers. The Fibonacci numbers are a sequence if integers, each of which is the sum of the previous two numbers. The first two numbers in the sequence are 0 and 1. Explain why you would not normally use recursion to solve this problem.

## 12.6

Write a recursive method that returnss the value of N! (N factorial) using the definition given in this chapter. Explain why you would not normally use recursion to solve this problem.

## 12.7

Write a recursive method to reverse a string. Explain why you would not normally use recursion to solve this problem.

## 12.10

Produce a chart showing the number of moves required to solve the Towers of Hanoi puzzle using the following number of disks: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, and 25.
