/* In-Class Project 4

   1. working with a team, decide on a new object that can be broken down
      into components (perhaps a car, house, computer, being, computer
      structure)
   2. describe and discuss with your team how each component is supposed
      to behave and be interacted with (start with a quick list or sketch of
      what attributes and behaviors each component needs)
   3. divide the components up among the team and implement java interfaces
      for as many components as you can for your object
   4. design tests for each of the components that would demonstrate that your
      attributes are within expected ranges and that the behaviors are working
      properly with good inputs and responding properly to bad inputs
