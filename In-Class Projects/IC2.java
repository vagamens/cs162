/* In-Class Project 2
   
   1. Add read and write functionality (and discuss this weird try-catch
   language feature and FileNotFoundException class) to the menu programs
   2. decompose capabilities into automated reusable methods.
   3. discuss how we might document our processes (designing, testing, 
   implementation, communication, reflection)
   4. write and run tests on our projects
   5. discuss reflection and documentation for later discussion
