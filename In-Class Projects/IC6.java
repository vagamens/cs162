/* In-Class Project 6 

   1. create an event listener for each of:
      1. a button
      2. a checkbox
      3. a radio button
      4. a textbox
      5. a textfield
   2. register a copy of each listener with two
      instances of an appropriate object
   3. demonstrate that the objects invoke the listeners
      (possibly just output to a terminal or maybe something
      more exciting, just make sure it is obvious)
   4. create a brief design for the pile of components in this
      week's take-home assignment
