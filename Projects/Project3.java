/* Project 3
   pg438: 8.16 (Circles)

   Write a program that draws 20 circles, with the radious and location of each
   circle determined at random. If a circle does not overlap any other circle,
   draw that circle in black. If a circle overlaps one or more other circle,
   then determine the color of each circle. Two circles overlap if the distance
   between their center points is less than the sum of eithr radii.
