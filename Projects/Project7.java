/* Project 7
   pg534: 10.6 (Graphic Sort)

   Write a program that graphically displays the processing of a selection
   sort. Use bars of various heights to represent the values being sorted.
   Display the set of bars after each swap. Put a delay in the processing of
   the sort to give the human observer a chance to see how the order of the
   values changes.
