   Write a program that reads a sequence of up to 25 pairs of names and postal
   (ZIP) codes for individuals. Store the data in an object designed to store
   a first name (string), lastname (string), and postal code (integer). Assume
   each line of input will contain two strings followed by an integer value,
   each separated by a tab character. Then, after the input has been read in,
   print the list in an appropriate format to the screen.
